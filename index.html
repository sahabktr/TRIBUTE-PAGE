          <h2>Father of the Nation</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,
             anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead
             the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule, and to later inspire 
             movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Born and raised in a Hindu family 
             in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to 
             the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a 
             successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. 
             He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, 
             Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, 
             ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with 
             hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on 
             religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate 
             homeland for Muslims within British India. Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, 
             the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, 
             especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, 
             a militant Hindu nationalist from western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest 
             at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.

             Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide 
             as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, 
             considered the Father of the Nation in India and was commonly called Bapu
